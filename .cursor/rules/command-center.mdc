# Command Center Specification: Agent Command HQ

## Core Interface Components

### 1. Dashboard Overview
- **Agent Fleet Summary**: Visual cards showing total active agents, agents requiring attention, and system health status
- **Activity Timeline**: Real-time feed of agent activities across the system
- **Resource Utilization**: Dynamic graphs showing CPU, memory, and storage usage
- **Key Performance Metrics**: Custom KPIs for agent response times, task completion rates, etc.

### 2. Agent Directory
- **Grid/List View Toggle**: Modern, sortable view of all agents with status indicators
- **Quick-Filter System**: Instantly filter agents by status, type, last activity, etc.
- **Search with Natural Language**: "Show me all agents that processed more than 1000 requests yesterday"
- **Batch Operations**: Select multiple agents for mass updates or configuration changes

### 3. Agent Detail View
- **Command Console**: Direct interface to communicate with the agent
- **Vitals Dashboard**: Performance metrics specific to this agent
- **Conversation History**: Searchable log of all interactions
- **Prompt Engineering Interface**: Code editor for modifying initialization prompts with syntax highlighting
- **Container Management**: Resource allocation controls, restart/pause options
- **Storage Integration Hub**: One-click connections to AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob, etc.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **State Management**: Redux for complex state management across components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent styling
- **Component Library**: Shadcn/UI for elegant, accessible components
- **Visualizations**: Recharts for performance graphs, D3.js for complex visualizations

### Backend
- **API Architecture**: GraphQL for flexible data fetching
- **Subscription Model**: WebSockets for real-time updates
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with MFA support
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes integration for agent scaling
- **Logging**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for comprehensive logging
